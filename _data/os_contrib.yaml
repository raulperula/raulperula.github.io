  description: In a collaboration between the University Rey Juan Carlos I (URJC) and Google, the goal of this project is to explore the use of Scratch with robots, both simulated and real. JdeRobot is a project that allows and simplifies the use of them. We started with simulated robots in Gazebo, despite with real robots because the interfaces are the same. This project expected to develop a new tool prototype that reads Scratch programs and translate them into ROS-Python components.

  description: I developed an artificial vision machine learning system using ROS in order to improve the detection and the identification of daily use objects. Specifically, I implemented a SIFT-based system able to integrate between the 2D (SIFT) and 3D (PointCloud) information coming from a kinect camera. The system proved to be successful in improving the vision-based detection and labeling of a set of objects.
