- title: "HANDLE - Developmental pathway towards autonomy and dexterity in robot in-hand manipulation FP7-ICT-2007-3-231640"
  authors: "European Union Seventh Framework Program"
  year: 2013
  website: https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/231640/reporting
  description: The HANDLE project aims at understanding how humans perform the manipulation of objects in order to replicate grasping and skilled in-hand movements with an anthropomorphic artificial hand, and thereby move robot grippers from current best practice towards more autonomous, natural and effective articulated hands.
