# Prerequisites

 * C++/Python development skills, also Arduino would be helpful.
 * Git/SVN versioning systems (not mandatory, they can be learned on the go).
 * Basic knowledge of 3D printers, control engineering, basic AI, computer vision, robotics would be helpful.
 * ROS knowledge would be helpful (not mandatory, ROS indigo version).
 * Linux knowledge would be helpful (all the robots code runs on Ubuntu 14.04).
 * English skills would be helpful (research articles are usually in this language).

# Expected results

 * Things you will learn (if you do not know previously):
   * ROS
   * robotics perception
   * robotics control
   * standard computer science skills 
   * machine learning (depending on project)
   * optimization techniques (depending on project)
 * If all goes well, a publication for the TFM projects is more than reasonable.
 * A cool demo is always something to be proud of.


# TFG (6 to 8 month projects)

## Project 1: Development of an Arduino UNO compatible shield for the ProtoCREA robot

**Robot**: [ProtoCREA]()

**Supervisor**: *Raúl Pérula-Martínez* (UC3M)

**Supervisor**: *Félix Rodríguez Cañadillas* (CREA Robótica Educativa)

**Status**: Assigned (Fernando Landrove Castellanos)

### Task 1.1. Analysis and definitions

 * Analyze different kind of Arduino-based boards.
 * Define power stage for 2 DC motors (using 2 digital IO pins).
 * Define safe connections.
  * 3 US (4 pins, 3 connectors, no PWM).
  * 6 analog (3 pins, 6 connectors).
  * 3 digital (3 pins, 4 connectors, PWM).
  * I2C (compass, inclinometer, accelerometer).
 * Define power control.
 * Define ON/OFF and Reset buttons.
 
### Task 1.2. Design and basic tests

 * Design the power stage.
 * Design shield.
 * Tests in a prototype.

### Task 1.3. Fabrication

 * Build shield.
 * Exhaustive tests.
 
### Task 1.4. Integration in the robot

 * Try some common scenarios using the new shield in their tasks.


## Project 2: Imagination + Engineering: some scenarios to teach robotics in school

**Robot**: [ProtoCREA]()

**Supervisor**: *Raúl Pérula-Martínez* (UC3M)

**Supervisor**: *Félix Rodríguez Cañadillas* (CREA Robótica Educativa)

**Status**: Assigned (Víctor Jiménez Bermejo)

### Task 2.1. Scenarios for teaching

 * Find the most useful scenarios for teaching robotics.
 * Design those scenarios in a cheaper way.
 * Decide what sensors or actuators are necessary.
 
### Task 2.2. Robotic Plug-ins

 * Design several modular plug-ins for each scenario.
 * Print those designs using a 3D printer.

### Task 2.3. Quality Tests

 * Test every plug-in developed using the real robot.
 * Document a complete example of use for each scenario.
 
### Task 2.4. Experiment

 * Do a questionnaire asking some children in a school if the scenarios and plug-ins are useful.


# TFM (8 to 12 month projects)

## Project 1: Implementing an integrated people recognizer

**Robot**: [Maggie Research Robot](http://wiki.ros.org/Robots/Maggie)

**Supervisor**: *Raúl Pérula-Martínez*

**Status**: Not Assigned
