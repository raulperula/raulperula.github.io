Printbots (PRINTable roBOTS) are usually Open Source robots shared to all the world. These robots can be built by an Open Source 3d printer.

## RPMBot

One of my first printbots was the RPMBot (<b><i>Figure 1</i></b>). The RPMBot is a small mobile robot printed by a 3d printer available at the UC3M.

This robot can be printed following the steps published on [Thingiverse](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:23753){:target="_blank"}. In addition, you can see how it works in the next videos (sorry about the quality).

## Robot colony

Together with the team of RPC, we build a colony of 10 mobile mini-robots. These robots were made to try to simulate behaviors of a bio-inspired animal colony.

## Speedy

This robot was created in another project together with the team of RPC. In this case, we pretend to build from scratch a light robot working as speed robot. The main task of this robot was to follow a line in a closed circuit as faster as possible.
