3D printing or additive manufacturing is a process of making three dimensional solid objects from a digital file. A 3D printer is a type of industrial robot.

## Description

Together with my team from the <a href="http://ieee.uc3m.es/" target="_blank">Robotics Society (ASROB) & IEEE Student Branch</a> at the UC3M, we maintained a "Printed Valley" which is a placed where there are two 3d printers available for  student projects.

We are mainly interested in new ways to use this technology in robotics, more specifically in educational robotics, to create fast prototypes or accessories that complement this field. You can find some of my designs in my <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/ra_ules" target="_blank">Thingiverse</a> profile.

Furthermore, I created a collaboration between ASROB and <a href="https://crea-robotica.com/" target="_blank">CREA Educational Robotics</a> in which we do a workshop (<b><i>Figure 2</i></b>) for constructing your own Open Source low-cost 3d printer as showed in <b><i>Figure</i></b> from above.
